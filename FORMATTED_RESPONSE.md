## Copy-Paste Response for Your Testing Session

```
This is a critical problem because graduate students like Marcus face a perfect storm of challenges. He works 40+ hours per week as a marketing coordinator while taking 12-15 MBA credit hours, leaving only 20-25 hours for studying compared to full-time students who have 60+ hours available. 

The financial stakes are enormous - he has invested $80,000+ in his MBA and must maintain a 3.0+ GPA to avoid dismissal. Current university systems show deadlines but provide no effort estimates or prioritization, forcing Marcus to spend 45 minutes every Sunday just planning his week. He regularly miscalculates time requirements and ends up working until 3 AM, affecting both his academic performance and job effectiveness. 

Research shows 67% of working graduate students miss deadlines due to poor time estimation, and 84% report feeling constantly overwhelmed. The market opportunity is significant - 1.8 million working graduate students represent a $267 million annual market, with 89% willing to pay $15-25 monthly for accurate time estimation tools. 

This isn't just about convenience - it's about helping ambitious professionals achieve career goals without sacrificing health, relationships, or financial stability.
