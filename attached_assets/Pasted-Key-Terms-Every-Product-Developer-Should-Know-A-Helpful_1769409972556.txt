Key Terms Every Product Developer Should Know
A Helpful Reference for Building Your MVP
What This Guide Is For
Product development comes with a lot of new words.
 This guide explains the most important product terms in plain language, so you can focus on building instead of memorizing jargon.
You don’t need to know everything at once — just enough to make good decisions.

Market Sizing Terms
Market sizing helps you understand how big the opportunity really is.
TAM — Total Addressable Market
What it means:
 TAM is the total number of people or businesses who could use your product if there were no limits at all.
Why it matters:
 It helps you understand the biggest possible opportunity your idea could reach.
Simple way to think about it:
 “If everyone who might need this product used it, how big would that be?”

SAM — Serviceable Available Market
What it means:
 SAM is the part of the market you can realistically reach, based on things like location, focus, or resources.
Why it matters:
 It helps you set realistic goals, not just big dreams.
Simple way to think about it:
 “Who can I actually serve right now?”

Problem-Solving Frameworks
These tools help you understand why problems exist, not just what they look like.
The 5 Whys Method
What it means:
 You ask “why?” over and over (usually five times) to uncover the real cause of a problem.
Why it matters:
 It helps you avoid fixing symptoms and instead fix the real issue underneath.
Simple example:
Why are orders late? → Because decisions are delayed


Why are decisions delayed? → Because no one owns them


Why does no one own them? → Because roles aren’t clear


Now you’ve found something you can actually fix.

Prioritization Frameworks
These help you decide what to build first when you have more ideas than time.
RICE Method
What it means:
 You score ideas based on:
Reach – How many people it affects


Impact – How much it helps them


Confidence – How sure you are


Effort – How much work it takes


Why it matters:
 It helps you compare ideas fairly and logically.
Simple way to think about it:
 “Which idea gives the most value for the least effort?”

ICE Method
What it means:
 A simpler version of RICE:
Impact


Confidence


Ease


Why it matters:
 It’s faster and useful when you need to make decisions quickly.
Simple way to think about it:
 “What’s impactful, likely to work, and easy to try?”

MoSCoW Method
What it means:
 You group ideas into:
Must Have – required for the product to work


Should Have – important but not critical


Could Have – nice extras


Won’t Have (for now) – intentionally delayed


Why it matters:
 It prevents scope creep and keeps your MVP focused.
Simple way to think about it:
 “What do we need right now versus later?”

Other Essential Product Terms
MVP — Minimum Viable Product
What it means:
 The simplest version of your product that still solves the main problem.
Why it matters:
 It lets you test ideas with real users before spending too much time or money.
Simple way to think about it:
 “The smallest thing I can build to start learning.”

PRD — Product Requirements Document
What it means:
 A document that explains:
What the product should do


Who it’s for


Why it matters


Why it matters:
 It keeps everyone aligned and reduces confusion.
Simple way to think about it:
 “A shared plan so everyone builds the same thing.”

Product-Market Fit
What it means:
 When your product solves a real problem so well that users keep coming back and recommend it.
Why it matters:
 This is the sign that it’s time to grow and invest more.
Simple way to think about it:
 “People would be disappointed if this product disappeared.”

Final Thought
You don’t need to memorize every term.
 What matters is using these ideas to think clearly, make better decisions, and learn faster.
Product development isn’t about fancy language — it’s about understanding problems and building smart solutions.
