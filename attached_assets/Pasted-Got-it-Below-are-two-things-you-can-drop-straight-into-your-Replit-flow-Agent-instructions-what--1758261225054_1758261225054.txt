Got it. Below are two things you can drop straight into your Replit flow:

Agent instructions (what to do with the attached GTM output and how to transform it using the PDBuilder GTM step), and

A standardized GTM document (headings/sub-headings/bullets) generated from the attached content. 

Go_To_Market_Strategy

A) Replit Agent — update/format instructions
Goal: Parse the attached GTM output, normalize it using the PDBuilder GTM step (schema + step from our previous message), and render a standard GTM strategy (Markdown/HTML) with clear headings, sub-headings, and bullets.

1) Inputs
Source doc: /mnt/data/Go_To_Market_Strategy.docx (GTM draft). 

Go_To_Market_Strategy

PDBuilder GTM step:

Input schema: pdBuilder.gtm.schema.v1

Agent step prompt: gtm_step_v1

Output contract: pdBuilder.gtm.plan.v1

2) Parse & map
Extract canonical sections from the doc:

Target Market → summary.market

Value Proposition → messaging.positioning (core benefit) + later “Hero”

Positioning Statement → messaging.positioning

Pricing Strategy → add under “Pricing & Packaging”

Distribution Channels → “Channels”

Marketing Tactics → “Programs & Plays”

Launch Plan → “Execution Timeline”

Key Success Metrics → “Metrics (AARRR)”

Competitive Advantage → “Differentiation”

Keep all original numbers, thresholds, and milestones; do not invent data.

3) Normalize with GTM step
Build a minimal pdBuilder.gtm.schema.v1 input using the doc content:

product.name = "<App name from doc>"

persona.title/segment/pain_points inferred from “mid-career working grad students”

growth_motion = "PLG" (implied by app stores, freemium) — adjust if needed

target_market = "NicheVertical"

acquisition_channels = ["Owned","Paid","Ecosystem"]

launch_approach = "SoftBeta" → "PublicLaunch" (per timelines)

core_programs = ["ContentEngine","OnboardingExcellence","ReferralsAffiliates"]

metric_priority = ["Activation","Retention","Revenue"]

constraints.budget_monthly_usd = leave blank if not in doc

Call gtm_step_v1 → validate JSON against pdBuilder.gtm.plan.v1.

4) Render standard document
Merge:

Authoritative content from the doc (numbers, claims, plans) with

Structural scaffolding from pdBuilder.gtm.plan.v1 (headings, checklists).

Output Markdown with H1/H2/H3 + bullet points (no prose walls).

Preserve doc’s KPIs, milestones, prices, and program names verbatim.

5) Save & expose
Write to /mnt/data/GTM_Strategy_Standardized.md

(Optional) Also export HTML for CMS use: /mnt/data/GTM_Strategy_Standardized.html

B) Standard GTM Strategy (formatted from the attached doc)
Go-To-Market Strategy
1) Target Market
Beachhead: Mid-career graduate students (28–45) in part-time/online programs (MBA, MPH, MSCS) who work full-time and have family obligations; geos: US, Canada, UK.

Size (directional):

US grad students ~3.1M; 40–60% work full-time ⇒ ~1.3–1.9M

Canada/UK add ~0.3–0.4M ⇒ ~1.6–2.3M serviceable segment

24-mo SOM: 150k–300k users via DTC + institutional pilots

Revenue potential (@ $79 ARPA/year): $11.9–$23.7M annually

Category context: Sub-segment of higher-ed time-management/adaptive support within broader EdTech market (est. $5–8B relevant slice)

2) Value Proposition
Promise: Never miss academic deadlines due to poor time allocation.

MVP outcomes:

Adaptive scheduling that fits around work/family

Bite-sized, time-boxed study blocks aligned to course requirements

Smart reminders + protected quiet hours

Simple onboarding that turns goals → realistic weekly plan

Result: More on-time submissions, less stress, sustained work performance

3) Positioning & Messaging
Positioning statement:
For working grad students juggling jobs and family, our cross-device study-time orchestration app converts syllabi + work calendars into realistic, adaptive study plans (with quiet hours and wellbeing nudges). Unlike generic productivity tools or course platforms, we cut stress and missed deadlines for working learners.

Hero & CTAs (for landing)
Hero idea: “Study on schedule—without burning out.”

Primary CTAs: “Start Free” · “See a 2-Minute Demo”

4) Pricing & Packaging
Free: Core scheduling, up to 2 synced calendars, basic reminders, single device

Pro: $9.99/mo or $79/yr — unlimited devices/sync, adaptive guidance, quiet-hour automation, advanced reminders, priority support

Team/Institution: $5–$7/user/mo (min 50) — SSO, cohort templates, onboarding webinars, usage reporting

Rationale: Above to-do apps (Todoist $4–$6/mo, Notion $8/user/mo) due to academic specialization; well below MOOCs (Coursera Plus ~$59/mo) & time-tracking suites; annual plan to lift cash flow and retention; institutional price aligns with student wellness/success budgets

5) Channels (Acquisition & Distribution)
Direct-to-Consumer: iOS/Android app stores + web app

University Partnerships: Part-time/online programs & student services

Professional Networks: LinkedIn targeting working grads + employer ERGs

6) Core Programs & Tactics
Paid/Targeting:

LinkedIn campaigns to roles (PM, Consultant, Nurse Manager, SWE) filtering for MBA/Master’s status

Creative: reduced stress + on-time submission; calendar-integrated demos

Content/SEO:

Program-specific templates (e.g., “12-Week MBA Quant Study Plan”)

Lead magnets (e.g., “Weekend Research Sprint Playbook”) → email → trial

Institutional pilots:

Evening/online MBA co-branded onboarding webinars

Faculty-approved study-block templates; secure testimonials/case studies
