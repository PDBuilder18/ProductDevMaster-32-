1. Overview

Product Name: PDBuilder

It ensures all essential investor-ready sections are included, formatted professionally, and exportable as PPTX, PDF, and shareable link formats.

2. Objective

Help founders build investor-grade pitch decks aligned with the Sequoia Capital framework in minutes.

Standardize storytelling across PDBuilder users for consistency and credibility.

Provide AI-assisted guidance, examples, and editable templates to accelerate deck creation.

Success Metrics:

≥ 75% completion rate from idea input → deck generation.

≥ 60% of users export/share generated decks.

≥ 30% of free users upgrade to premium for deck customization or AI coaching.

3. Problem Statement

Many early-stage founders struggle to:

Structure their story in investor-standard formats.

Design clear, consistent slides quickly.

Align messaging with what VCs expect (market, traction, team, vision, etc.).

The Sequoia template is widely recognized but hard to execute well. PDBuilder can solve this by making the format interactive, guided, and automated.
