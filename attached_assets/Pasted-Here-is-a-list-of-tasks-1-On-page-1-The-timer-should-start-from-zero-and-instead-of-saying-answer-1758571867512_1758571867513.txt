Here is a list of tasks
1) On page 1 - The timer should start from zero and instead of saying answer all 5 questions say answer all questions.

2) I am sending you new resources with titles in the next email so add them and delete the current 3 items in the resources section

3) Step 4 is producing output that is hallucination (maybe in some cases) Ask replit to put in safeguards for this step to not be a hallucination but stay on the topic described by the user.

4) Replace the 'product roadmap' step in the end with 'Problem-Solution Validation' step and add the step to download it 

Here are the replit instructions for it

Pdbuilder Problem–solution Validation Module — Step‑by‑step Flow (replit Integration)

PDBuilder Problem–Solution Validation Module — Step‑by‑Step Flow (Replit Integration)
This document translates the Problem→Solution Validation method into an implementation‑ready flow for PDBuilder running on Replit (Shopify‑embedded app, Supabase backend, Replit Agent helpers). It includes a state machine, UI prompts, data model, API endpoints, agent tasks, metrics, and gating rules.

0) Scope & Objectives
Goal: Reduce build risk by validating problem severity, segment fit, message–market resonance, usability, and willingness‑to‑pay before MVP build.

Key outputs:

Hypothesis Cards (assumptions + success metrics)

Interview notes & Pain/Urgency scoring

Micro‑survey (quant) heatmap

Smoke‑test landing metrics (CTR, Signup%, CPS)

WTP corridor (Van Westendorp) & proposed price

Prototype test usability findings

Concierge/Wizard‑of‑Oz signal (optional)

Validation Readout + Decision (Go / Refine / No‑Go)

Default sprint: 7–10 days.

1) State Machine (User Journey)
Represented as steps with entry/exit criteria. Each step writes artifacts to Supabase and emits analytics events.

Define Hypotheses

Purpose: Convert PRD + ICP + GTM assumptions into 3–5 falsifiable hypotheses + success thresholds.

Inputs: PRD problem statement, target persona(s), channel assumptions.

UI: Wizard form with templated prompts (see UI prompts below).

Capture: assumption, risk_type (market/tech/adoption), metric, success_threshold.

Exit criteria: ≥3 hypotheses saved.

Next: Recruit Target Users.

Recruit Target Users

Purpose: Identify 12–20 qualified participants.

Inputs: Persona, channels, incentive.

UI: Outreach message generator (DM/email/post), contact table with status (invited/accepted/scheduled).

Capture: channel, contact_handle, status, consent.

Exit: ≥8 interviews scheduled or ≥12 accepted survey invites.

Next: Problem Interviews (can run in parallel with Micro‑Survey).

Problem Interviews (Qual)

Purpose: Validate frequency, severity, triggers, workarounds.

UI: Interview guide with note fields; sliders for Pain(1–5), Urgency(1–5).

Capture: quotes, events, tools used, costs, scores.

Exit: ≥8 complete; mean Pain ≥3.5 triggers amber; ≥4.0 green.

Next: Micro‑Survey and Synthesis.

Micro‑Survey (Quant)

Purpose: Rank top pains; estimate frequency and WTP at a high level.

UI: Form generator (5–7 Q) with share links; response dashboard.

Capture: frequency, severity, current solutions, price ranges, email (opt‑in).

Exit: n≥30 responses; ≥50% Weekly+ frequency and ≥40% Severity≥4 → green.

Next: Smoke Test.

Landing Page Smoke Test

Purpose: Message–market resonance without building product.

UI: One‑pager generator (headline, 3 bullets, CTA), UTM tracking.

Capture: impressions, clicks (CTR), signups (conversion), cost per signup (CPS).

Exit: CTR ≥2–3% (ads) and Signup ≥8–15% (cold) / ≥20–30% (warm) → green.

Next: WTP + Prototype Test.

Willingness‑to‑Pay (Van Westendorp)

Purpose: Price corridor validation.

UI: 4‑question block after signup or via follow‑up email.

Exit: Planned price within corridor for ≥60% respondents → green.

Next: Prototype Test.

Prototype Test (Usability)

Purpose: Validate concept comprehension and core task success.

UI: Upload link to Figma/storyboard; define 1–2 tasks; record completion & Single‑Ease Question (1–7).

Exit: ≥70% task completion unprompted; SEQ ≥4.5 → green.

Next: Concierge (optional) or Synthesis.

Concierge / Wizard‑of‑Oz (Optional)

Purpose: Validate repeat usage and pay intent by manually delivering value.

Exit: ≥40% “very disappointed” if removed or ≥30% commit to pay on automation → green.

Next: Synthesis.

Synthesize → Decision Gate

Purpose: Aggregate all signals into a Validation Readout and make a Go/Refine/No‑Go decision.

UI: Dashboard with red/amber/green chips per metric; Agent‑generated summary.

Exit: Decision selected; next module routed (MVP Scoping if Go; return to PRD/GTM if Refine/No‑Go).

2) UI Prompts (embed directly in forms/wizards)
Hypotheses

“In one sentence, what urgent problem are you solving for ?”

“List a behavior you believe is true today (falsifiable).”

“What metric would prove this false quickly?”

“Set a success threshold (e.g., ≥20% signup intent).”

Recruitment

“Where does this persona hang out online?”

“Pick an incentive: gift card / early access / feedback credit.”

“Generate 3 outreach variants.”

Interviews

“Describe the last time this problem occurred.”

“What did you try; what was hard, costly, or slow?”

“Rate pain (1–5) and urgency (1–5).”

Survey

“How often do you face ?”

“How severe is the impact?”

“What do you use today?”

“What would you pay monthly to remove this?”

Smoke Test

“Outcome‑first headline.”

“Three crisp benefit bullets.”

“Choose CTA (Join Beta / Early Access / Learn More).”

Prototype

“Upload prototype link.”

“Define one success task.”

“Single‑Ease score (1–7).”

Decision Gate

“Do metrics meet green thresholds? Select Go / Refine / No‑Go and auto‑create next sprint plan.”

11) Security & Privacy
Store emails separately and encrypt at rest; restrict PII columns via Row Level Security (RLS) on participants and survey_responses.

Consent checkbox required for storing contact info.

Export feature should scrub PII by default unless explicitly included.

12) Testing & Rollout
Seed data script: create demo run with 3 hypotheses, 5 dummy participants, 8 interviews, 40 survey responses, one landing set, and 6 prototype tests.

Feature flag: validation_module_enabled per project.

QA checklist: form validation, RLS policies, decision logic unit tests, PDF export of Readout.

13) Definition of Done
Users can complete all steps, see green/amber/red chips, and generate a one‑page Readout.

Decision routes the user to MVP Scoping (if Go) or back to PRD/GTM with a prefilled refinement plan.
