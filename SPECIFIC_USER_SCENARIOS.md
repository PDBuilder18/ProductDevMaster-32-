# Specific User Scenarios for Productivity App Testing

## Who Experiences This Problem

### Primary User Personas

**1. Overwhelmed Undergraduates (Ages 18-22)**
- Junior and senior students taking 15+ credit hours
- Students juggling coursework with part-time jobs
- Those in demanding majors (engineering, pre-med, business)
- First-generation college students without academic support systems

**2. Graduate Students (Ages 22-28)**
- PhD candidates managing research deadlines and coursework
- Master's students balancing thesis work with classes
- Teaching assistants handling multiple responsibilities
- International students adapting to new academic systems

**3. Non-Traditional Students (Ages 25+)**
- Working parents returning to school
- Career changers pursuing degrees while employed
- Veterans transitioning to civilian education
- Students with learning differences or ADHD

## When This Problem Occurs

### Critical Time Periods

**Semester Transitions:**
- First 2 weeks: Course registration chaos, syllabus overload
- Weeks 3-6: Reality sets in, workload becomes clear
- Midterm season (weeks 7-10): Peak stress, multiple deadlines
- Finals period (weeks 14-16): Everything due simultaneously

**Daily Pain Points:**
- Sunday evenings: "Sunday scaries" realizing what's due
- Early mornings: Forgetting which assignments are prioritized
- Between classes: Quick deadline checks on mobile devices
- Late nights: Panic about forgotten submissions

**Academic Calendar Events:**
- Start of each semester: New course load confusion
- Before major holidays: Compressed deadline periods
- Registration periods: Planning next semester while managing current
- Job/internship application seasons: Competing priorities

## Specific Problem Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Computer Science Junior
**Who:** Sarah, 20, Computer Science major at large state university
**When:** Week 8 of fall semester, taking 6 courses including 3 programming-heavy classes
**Problem:** Has 4 programming projects, 2 exams, and 1 research paper due within 10 days
**Current Tools:** Uses Google Calendar but can't prioritize, sticky notes everywhere
**Pain Point:** Spends 30 minutes each morning figuring out what to work on first

### Scenario 2: Working Graduate Student
**Who:** Marcus, 26, MBA student working full-time as marketing coordinator
**When:** Thursdays after work, trying to plan weekend study schedule
**Problem:** University LMS shows 15 different deadlines but no indication of time required or importance
**Current Tools:** Tries to use work project management tools for school but they don't integrate
**Pain Point:** Regularly miscalculates time needed, stays up until 3 AM finishing assignments

### Scenario 3: Pre-Med Student with ADHD
**Who:** Elena, 19, Biology major on pre-med track with diagnosed ADHD
**When:** Daily, especially during high-stress periods like MCAT prep
**Problem:** Executive function challenges make prioritization extremely difficult
**Current Tools:** Multiple apps and systems that she forgets to check consistently
**Pain Point:** Hyperfocuses on less important tasks while critical deadlines approach

## Test Input Examples

Use these specific scenarios in your conversation:

**Input Option 1:**
```
Specifically, I'm targeting junior and senior college students (ages 20-22) who are taking 15+ credit hours and working part-time jobs. This problem is most acute during weeks 7-10 of each semester when midterm deadlines pile up. Students like Sarah, a Computer Science major, spend 30 minutes every morning just figuring out which assignment to tackle first because current tools don't help prioritize based on effort required and deadline urgency.
```

**Input Option 2:**
```
The primary users are graduate students like Marcus, a 26-year-old MBA student working full-time. The problem hits hardest on Thursday evenings when he's trying to plan his weekend study schedule. His university's LMS shows 15 different deadlines but gives no indication of time required or relative importance, so he regularly miscalculates and ends up working until 3 AM.
```

**Input Option 3:**
```
I'm focused on students with ADHD like Elena, a 19-year-old pre-med Biology major. Her executive function challenges make prioritization extremely difficult, especially during high-stress periods like MCAT prep season. She hyperfocuses on less important tasks while critical deadlines approach because existing productivity apps assume neurotypical organization patterns.
```

## Expected AI Follow-Up Questions

After providing this specificity, the AI should ask about:
- Market size and validation methods
- Competitive landscape analysis  
- Specific feature requirements
- Business model considerations
- Technical implementation approach

This level of detail will help the AI generate much more targeted and valuable product requirements for your MVP.
